# Data-hiding-using-steganography-method
In this project,I have developed a data hiding mechanism using steganography technology in MATLAB. The secret messages can be encrypted in the images and again the messages can be decrypted. Though this project I have learnt so many cryptographic techniques.
T execute this code install matlab and add the message you want to send in private in a txt file and copy that link of the file location and add that to the matlab.Execute the code by clicking the run method.The goal of this project was to implement an application that uses the LSB steganography method in order to hide and recover data. Because communication involves a sender and a receiver, there are two ways in which the application can run: as an encoder or as a decoder. For the encoding part the message is hidden into the least significant bits of a bmp image, thus resulting the stego-image. This image is then given to the decoder to extract the data that has been hidden. The parallelization of the serial version of the algorithm was done using boss-worker threading model. Both data hiding and data recovery can be done in parallel.
